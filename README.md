# Thesis-Website

In order to adjust my master thesis experiment to a Covid-19 safe environment, I turned the experiment into a website based experiment, using Javascript. This would allow me to reach out to participants without having to come into personal contact with them. At the point I made the decision to build this website, covid restrictions had been tightened in the Netherlands and face-to-face contact had been limited and Universities had been closed.

This is the first website I have built. It's purpose was not to look pretty, but to facilitate a scientific experiment and therefore was supposed to be as unobtrusive as possible with no distractions to take attention away from the experiment on screen.

### Running the experiment

Originally the website was hosted on the Google App Engine. All files to make sure that works are included in the files. It can also be run through an IDE, if you just wish to have a look at it, and that wouldn't require the .yaml/.pyc files.

### Sounds and images

The sounds and images that were used in the experiment have been included in the files. The sounds were generated with VoiceOver from MacOS and recorded with Audacity. The images were taken from the Novel Objects and Unusual Names database (Horst & Hout, 2016). Which can be found here: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/wordlab/noun
